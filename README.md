# Exam Cell Automation
* **Motivation:** The current University Exam Cell Activities are done on paper. This leads to
tedious work for the students and for the department responsible for carrying out
examination activities. Developing an online solution will lead to quicker,
efficient, simpler and error free activities to overcome the drawbacks of the
manual paper based system.
* This modular system is developed to simplify examination related activities for faculty and students. 
* **Students utilities:** 
   * After completing online registration, login credentials provided 
   * After login, students can: Procure/ print admit cards, view exam schedule, view exam results, view uploaded notices
* **Faculty:** 
   * Update exam schedule 
   * Update exam results
   * Upload notices

## Technologies used:
